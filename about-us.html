        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            During the six weeks bootcamp, I want to upgrade my software engineering skills. 
            To learn to build robust software, and become a world class sofware engineer.<br>

            Getting an offer from PwC would also be pretty neat.
